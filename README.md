**CONTEXT**


Since I've been working on data science, I was exposed to **problem-solving strategies** so as to move from real problems to real solutions. Somehow, this was a natural complement to one of the things I'm most passionate about: the way we perceive our surrounding world and how our mind works.

After reading many books, attending many courses and doing a bunch of data science projects, I felt the need to define how I should **move from real-world problems to real-world solutions in a structured way**.

So, the purpose of **this brief material** is to share my **initial summary** of how to **structure a problem-solving strategy**. I emphasize that it is just my initial MVP about this subject. In other words, it is not supposed to be a definitive solution, not even to replace any already tested framework! 

In fact, this is just an initial attempt to structure problem-solving strategies holistically, taking into account the planning stage as well as general guidelines to monitor the project and product development so as to **achieve meaningful business results consistently**, especially through data science tools. 

**This initial template must evolve over time**, especially with learning from practical experience, to help solve the problems of the ever-changing world!

My first idea was to learn these tactics deeply by thinking about them and combining them. *The way I use this material is to, once in a while or if I get lost at some point in the project, get back here, check where I am in the problem-solving track and remember some key points about this step*. I'm sharing this compilation so anyone interested in this topic can learn or remember something relevant to solve some real problem: if this happens somehow, I would be very happy! By the way, contact me for feedback about this material by checking the "contacts" section ;)

As an important note, **I didn't create any of these problem-solving tactics!** I'm just a curious guy that loves to study and wants to improve my professional solutions as a data scientist. So, please take at least a brief **look** at **the resources section** to understand where this information came from.
