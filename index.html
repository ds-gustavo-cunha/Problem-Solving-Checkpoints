        <p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p>Since I've been working on data science, I was exposed to <strong>problem-solving strategies</strong> so as to move from real problems to real solutions. Somehow, this was a natural complement to one of the things I'm most passionate about: the way we perceive our surrounding world and how our mind works.</p>
<p>After reading many books, attending many courses and doing a bunch of data science projects, I felt the need to define how I should <strong>move from real-world problems to real-world solutions in a structured way</strong>.</p>
<p>So, the purpose of <strong>this brief material</strong> is to share my <strong>initial summary</strong> of how to <strong>structure a problem-solving strategy</strong>. I emphasize that it is just my initial MVP about this subject. In other words, it is not supposed to be a definitive solution, not even to replace any already tested framework!</p>
<p>In fact, this is just an initial attempt to structure problem-solving strategies holistically, taking into account the planning stage as well as general guidelines to monitor the project and product development so as to <strong>achieve meaningful business results consistently</strong>, especially through data science tools.</p>
<p><strong>This initial template must evolve over time</strong>, especially with learning from practical experience, to help solve the problems of the ever-changing world!</p>
<p>My first idea was to learn these tactics deeply by thinking about them and combining them. <em>The way I use this material is to, once in a while or if I get lost at some point in the project, get back here, check where I am in the problem-solving track and remember some key points about this step</em>. I'm sharing this compilation so anyone interested in this topic can learn or remember something relevant to solve some real problem: if this happens somehow, I would be very happy! By the way, contact me for feedback about this material by checking the &quot;contacts&quot; section ;)</p>
<p>As an important note, <strong>I didn't create any of these problem-solving tactics!</strong> I'm just a curious guy that loves to study and wants to improve my professional solutions as a data scientist. So, please take at least a brief <strong>look</strong> at <strong>the resources section</strong> to understand where this information came from.</p>

<p><strong>MAIN REFERENCES</strong></p>
<p>Here is a list of resources, books and courses, that were important to make this compilation possible. Note that <em>these resources are not in order of importance</em>; they are more or less in the order I had first contact with the given resource. Besides, I may even forget some specific resources once the process of compiling all this information was non-linear, non-centralized and have evolved throughout time.</p>
